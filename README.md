Teaching by Example:

This example solves the following problem.
Write a function to take a string parameter and return true if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return false. The parameter entered may have punctuation and symbols but they should not affect whether the string is in fact a palindrome. For example: "Anne, I vote more cars race Rome-to-Vienna" should return true

Build and run the example. 
The application can be executed from the command line in the directory .../bin/debug/palindrome.exe. If you do not supply any parameters then it will use the default "Noel sees Leon." and return true. 
Example: .../bin/debug/palindrome.exe "This sentence is not a palindrome."
Unit tests are also provided for further clarification and example of how to setup unit tests and what to test. Comments in code are there only for the student and would not normally be there.
